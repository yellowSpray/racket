<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Racket App is an application dedicated to squash tournament organizers (or similar sports) who wish to automate the management of registrations, matches, results, and player rankings.

Initially designed for personal use, it aims to offer a simple, secure, and scalable solution with three access levels:
* Player: Registers, unregisters, views their matches and ranking.
* Admin: Validates registrations, organizes matches, enters results, sends notifications.
* Super Admin: Manages admins and global settings.

The application automatically generates a match schedule based on:

* The number of available courts.
* The event's start time.
* The round-robin format.

After each tournament, a dynamic ranking system assigns points, allowing the best players to move up a level and the last ones to move down—thus creating an evolving league.
